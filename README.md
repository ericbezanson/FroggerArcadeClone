## FroggerArcadeClone
####In Browser
for quick access to the app visit this <a href="http://ericbezanson.github.io/FroggerArcadeClone/">Link</a>
####Local
To run the app locally you will need to use a local server, I suggest installing <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a> and while in the console navigate to the htdocs folder within MAMP and run: <pre>git clone https://github.com/ericbezanson/FroggerArcadeClone.git</pre>
######(note: MAMP is just a personal suggestion, any local server will do)

##Functionality
A clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. Use the Arrow keys to move and try and avoid the bugs while making your way to the water. For the best experience play with the console opened :)
